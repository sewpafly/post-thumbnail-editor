Fed up with the lack of automated tools to properly crop and scale post thumbnails? Maybe this plugin can help.

== Description ==

To meet the needs of themes where the post-thumbnails have random and capricious sizes (which causes wordpress to crop images simply from the middle (either chopping off the top and bottom or chopping off the sides), this plugin attempts to give the users an interface to manually fix those thumbnail and random images.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file from <http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/post-thumbnail-editor.zip>
2. Unzip to your wp-content/plugins directory under the wordpress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Rock On

= or =

1. Install from within your wordpress admin area by searching for "post thumbnail editor"
